# Specification: Frontend Architecture Standards

**Track ID:** frontend-architecture-standards_20260221
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Establish mandatory standards for frontend development, ensuring strict separation of concerns, type safety, and modern React patterns.

## Context

The project needs a sister skill to `application-architecture-standards` tailored for frontend applications (SPAs/Web Apps). The standards must ensure that frontend codebases remain maintainable, testable, and robust.

## User Story

As a frontend developer or AI agent, I want a clear set of standards for React development so that I can build high-quality, scalable, and type-safe user interfaces that are easy to test and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Project Layout**: Feature-based directory structure with explicit separation between `components` (reusable UI) and `views` (page-level layouts).
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Mandatory use of TypeScript and `typia` for runtime boundary validation.
- [ ] **State Management**:
  - **Server State**: Managed via TanStack Query.
  - **Client State**: Minimal local state (useState/useReducer) or Zustand for complex global state.
- [ ] **API Integration**: Schema-first approach (OpenAPI, GraphQL, etc.) with typechecked communication (e.g., via generated hooks or types).
- [ ] **Form Handling**: Use React Hook Form.
- [ ] **Logic Isolation**: Strict separation of business/state logic from View components using custom hooks or specialized services, ensuring logic is independently testable.
- [ ] **Testing**:
  - **Unit/Integration**: Vitest.
  - **E2E/Component**: Playwright.
- [ ] **UI/UX Development**:
  - **Component Isolation**: Storybook for developing and documenting custom components.
  - **Styling**: Mandatory use of **shadcn/ui** for foundational components; **Tailwind CSS** for custom styling and layout.
  - **Animation**: Framer Motion for animations.
- [ ] **Build Tooling**: Vite for builds and development.

## Technical Considerations

- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic should be moved out of components into hooks.
- **Styling Strategy**: Leverage **shadcn/ui** components as much as possible prior to building new custom ones. Use Tailwind CSS utilities for all custom styling.
- **Dependency Flow**: Views depend on Components and Hooks; Components are ideally pure or depend on minimal primitive props.
- **Documentation**: The skill must be comprehensive enough to guide an AI agent through a full feature implementation.
