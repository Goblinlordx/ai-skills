# Implementation Plan: Frontend Architecture Standards

**Track ID:** frontend-architecture-standards_20260221
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** [x] Complete

## Overview

We will create a new skill named `frontend-architecture-standards` that provides comprehensive, mandatory guidelines for React development using the specified modern stack.

## Phase 1: Skill Scaffolding & Core Philosophy

Create the directory structure and the foundational sections of the `SKILL.md`.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 1.1: Create `frontend-architecture-standards/SKILL.md` with metadata.
- [x] Task 1.2: Define the "Core Philosophy" section (Separation of concerns, type safety).
- [x] Task 1.3: Define the "Project Structure" section (Feature-based, Views vs Components).

### Verification

- [ ] `SKILL.md` exists and contains valid frontmatter.

## Phase 2: Technical Standards & Data Layer

Detail the guidelines for the data layer and type safety.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 2.1: Write the "Type Safety" section (TS + Typia).
- [x] Task 2.2: Write the "Data Fetching & API" section (TanStack Query + Schema-first).
- [x] Task 2.3: Write the "State Management" section (Zustand + local state).

### Verification

- [ ] Sections are comprehensive and include tool recommendations.

## Phase 3: Component & Logic Isolation

Detail the guidelines for UI development and unit testing.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 3.1: Write the "Logic Isolation" section (Custom hooks for business logic).
- [x] Task 3.2: Write the "Forms" section (React Hook Form).
- [x] Task 3.3: Write the "Testing" section (Vitest for logic, Playwright for UI/E2E).
- [x] Task 3.4: Write the "UI Development & Styling" section (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Storybook, Motion).

### Verification

- [ ] Guidelines explicitly describe how to separate logic from components.

## Phase 4: Examples & Walkthrough

Provide concrete examples to guide AI agents.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 4.1: Create an "Execution Example" section (e.g., building a product dashboard).
- [x] Task 4.2: Final review against the `spec.md` requirements.

### Final Verification

- [ ] All acceptance criteria from `spec.md` are documented in the skill.
- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable for AI agents.
