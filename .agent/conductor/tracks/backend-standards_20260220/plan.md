# Implementation Plan: Backend Standards Skill

**Track ID:** backend-standards_20260220
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

## Overview

The goal is to research and draft a cohesive, well-structured `SKILL.md` (and any necessary supporting markdown documents) outlining strict backend development standards for Gemini Antigravity. This plan is broken down into researching best practices, outlining the core principles, drafting the skill document according to the `agentskills.io` spec, and final review/refinement.

## Phase 1: Research and Foundation

Establish the core structure of the skill by researching best practices and compiling the required theoretical guidelines.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 1.1: Research industry best practices for schema-first design, Code Generation, DDD (Domain-Driven Design), Clean/Hexagonal Architecture, and TDD (Test-Driven Development) in modern backend development (Go, TypeScript, Python).
- [x] Task 1.2: Create the directory `backend-standards/` in the project root.
- [x] Task 1.3: Outline the sections for DDD, TDD, and Clean/Hexagonal Architecture based on the research.
- [x] Task 1.4: Outline the sections for schema-first design, code generation, dependency injection, and strong typing/boundary validation.

### Verification

- [x] Review outlines to ensure all technical requirements from the spec are accounted for and are backed by accurate best practices.

## Phase 2: Drafting the SKILL.md

Translate the research and outlines into actionable, agent-facing instructions adhering to the Agent Skills specification.

### Tasks

- [x] Task 2.1: Write the YAML frontmatter for the `SKILL.md` (`name: backend-standards`, `description`, etc.).
- [x] Task 2.2: Draft instructions for project setup using the predefined architectures (DDD, Clean Architecture) and TDD.
- [x] Task 2.3: Draft instructions for the schema-first API and persistence layer design (including code generation).
- [x] Task 2.4: Draft instructions for enforcing dependency injection, strong typing constraints, and system boundary validation.

### Verification

- [x] Ensure formatting aligns with the markdown styleguide located at `.agent/conductor/code_styleguides/markdown.md`.

## Phase 3: Review and Refinement

Ensure the instructions are concise, meaningful, and not overly vague.

### Tasks

- [ ] Task 3.1: Review the drafted `SKILL.md` for clarity and tone.
- [ ] Task 3.2: Add any necessary examples of inputs/outputs or edge cases (e.g., when compile-time checks are "absolutely impossible").

### Final Verification

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (Clear instructions, adheres to SKILL.md structure, sufficient information).
- [ ] No actual application code generated (Out of Scope check).
- [ ] Ready for review.
