# Specification: Application Architecture Standards

**Track ID:** backend-standards_20260220
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Generate a new skill for building backend systems, establishing standards and guidelines for how to accomplish this using modern best practices.

## Context

**Product Context:** Reusing common workflowThis track focuses on creating a new skill for Gemini Antigravity that establishes strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) for application architecture and development. The skill will provide detailed instructions for agents to follow when generating, refactoring, or architecting backend applications (APIs, CLIs, TUIs) across Go, TypeScript, and Python.

## Context

Currently, when tasked with backend-related work, AI agents might use varying architectural patterns, naming conventions, and testing strategies. This inconsistency makes the generated code harder to maintain and integrate into existing, well-structured projects. By defining a specific "Application Architecture Standards" skill, we can ensure agents adhere to modern, rigorous development practices, resulting in higher-quality, more predictable outputs.ild backend systems using a schema-first approach, code generation, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean/Hexagonal architecture, dependency injection, and strong typing with compile-time checks and boundary validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear instructions which are concise but meaningful.
- [ ] Adhere properly to SKILL.md structure.
- [ ] Provide sufficient information for agents when they use these instructions without being too vague.

## Dependencies

None

## Out of Scope

Creating any actual code. We are strictly generating a SKILL.md and supporting files/documents for an AI agent to use in the future.

## Technical Notes

- Promote a schema-first approach, leveraging code generation where possible (for data persistence and API layers).
- Require Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Utilize Clean/Hexagonal architecture and appropriate Dependency Injection.
- Enforce strong typing and compile-time checks.
- Mandate validation at system boundaries to ensure internal strong typing reliability.
