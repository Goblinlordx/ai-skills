# Specification: Backend Standards Skill

**Track ID:** backend-standards_20260220
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Generate a new skill for building backend systems, establishing standards and guidelines for how to accomplish this using modern best practices.

## Context

**Product Context:** Reusing common workflows and tasks in AI coding assistants, and establishing standard operating procedures for an AI coding assistant.
**Target Users:** AI Agents running tasks.
**Key Goals:** Provide a consistent set of standards for projects when using languages I commonly use. Specifically, golang, typescript, and python.

## User Story

As an AI, I want to have instructions such that I can design and build easily exposable, easily managable, and easily deployable applications so that I can reliably build backend systems using a schema-first approach, code generation, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean/Hexagonal architecture, dependency injection, and strong typing with compile-time checks and boundary validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear instructions which are concise but meaningful.
- [ ] Adhere properly to SKILL.md structure.
- [ ] Provide sufficient information for agents when they use these instructions without being too vague.

## Dependencies

None

## Out of Scope

Creating any actual code. We are strictly generating a SKILL.md and supporting files/documents for an AI agent to use in the future.

## Technical Notes

- Promote a schema-first approach, leveraging code generation where possible (for data persistence and API layers).
- Require Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Utilize Clean/Hexagonal architecture and appropriate Dependency Injection.
- Enforce strong typing and compile-time checks.
- Mandate validation at system boundaries to ensure internal strong typing reliability.
