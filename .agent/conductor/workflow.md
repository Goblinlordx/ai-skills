# Workflow Preferences

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Flexible** - tests recommended for complex logic.
_(Note: As this is a skills repository and not a traditional application, TDD application might be limited.)_

## Commit Strategy

**Conventional Commits** (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Code Review

**Required** for non-trivial changes.

## Verification Checkpoints

**Track Completion** - Manual verification is required only at track completion.
